# ðŸŽ¥ CineMetrics_MLproject

A machine learning project designed to empower film producers and stakeholders with predictive insights into audience response. By analyzing various movie attributes, this project aims to classify films into rating categories such as *Excellent*, *Good*, *Average*, or *Poor*â€”enabling smarter investment and production decisions in the early stages.

## Project Objective

This project explores the relationship between a movieâ€™s featuresâ€”such as budget, cast, genre, and marketingâ€”and its resulting audience reception, categorized into rating levels. By applying classification algorithms and neural networks, we aim to:

- Predict the **Rating_Category** of a movie before release
- Provide a data-driven framework for production planning
- Improve decision-making for marketing and investment strategies
